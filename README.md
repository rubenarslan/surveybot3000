# SurveyBot3000 holdout analysis
This repository is structured as follows

- The rmarkdown files (ending in `.Rmd`) load the empirical data from the holdout (pilot study) and validation study
  and the synthetic data generated by SurveyBot3000 (`1_vector_to_cosine.Rmd` for the pilot).
- Empirical correlations and synthetic cosine similarities are computed, and 
  Cronbach's alphas are computed from these (`1_vector_to_cosine.Rmd`, , `1_import_validation_study.Rmd`).
- The accuracies of the synthetic estimates are computed for the pilot study in `pilot_study.Rmd`
- In `3_rr_precision_simulations.Rmd`, we simulated the precision our validation study should achieve.
- The accuracies of the synthetic estimates are computed for the validation study in `validation_study.Rmd`
- In `se_sample_size.Rmd` we compare the margin of error of the synthetic estimates to equivalent empirical sample sizes 

In the folder docs, the knitted Rmd files can be browser as a website, containing code, tables and plots. The website serves as a comprehensive online supplement along with our more brief regular supplement.
